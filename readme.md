## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following software installed on your machine:

1. **Node.js** (v14 or above): [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. **Git**: [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

To check if they are installed, run these commands in your terminal:
```bash
node -v
git --version
```

If these commands return version numbers, you're good to go!

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project.

### 1. Clone the repository

Open your terminal or command prompt and clone the repository by running:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CallMeGodsent/miraquote-desktop.git
```

Navigate into the project directory:
```bash
cd miraquote-desktop
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Once youâ€™re inside the project directory, install the necessary dependencies using **npm** (Node Package Manager):
```bash
npm install
```

This command will download and install everything your project needs.

### 3. Running the app

After the dependencies are installed, you can launch the app by running:
```bash
npm start
```

This will start the Electron app and open it in a new window.

If you are following this step, please avoid the **release section of this project**
---

## Development Workflow

While developing the app, you'll mostly be working with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS files.

- **Hot reloading** is not available by default in Electron, so each time you make a change, restart the app:
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

---

## Building the App

To package the app for distribution (create an executable version), run the following command:
```bash
npm run build
```

This will package the app for your current operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Youâ€™ll find the generated files in the `dist` or `build` directory.

While this never worked for us for unknown reasons, we have put together in our doc how to get it done. Checkit out and dont miss out!
